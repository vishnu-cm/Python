Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.
The implementation of Python was started in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
In February 1991, Guido Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.
In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
Python 2.0 added new features such as list comprehensions, garbage collection systems.
On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify the fundamental flaw of the language.
