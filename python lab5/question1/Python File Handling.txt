Till now, we were taking the input from the console and writing it back to the console to interact with the user.

Sometimes, it is not enough to only display the data on the console. The data to be displayed may be very large, and only a limited amount of data can be displayed on the console since the memory is volatile, it is impossible to recover the programmatically generated data again and again.

The file handling plays an important role when the data needs to be stored permanently into the file. A file is a named location on disk to store related information. We can access the stored information (non-volatile) after the program termination.
